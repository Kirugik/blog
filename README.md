# My Personal Blog

This web application is my personal blog. I post my thoughts on various topics for purposes of documenting my knowledge and also allowing other people to learn from me.

# Description

I learn alot of things on a daily basis both in tech and in other fields as well. It is important to share this knowledge with others or at least document them for my future reference or when there is need. One way of doing so is blogging. I have created this personal blog website that allows me to create an account and continuosly post my thoughts on interesting topics that I would wish to share with others. Other people can also post on this personal blog but they are required to create an account first. For visitors who do not want to create an account, they can read posts by others and can like those posts or comment on them. Authenticated users can comment on any post and can delete insulting or degrading comments by others on the posts that they posted. Also authenticated users can delete their own posts.
